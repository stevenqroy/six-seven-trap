# V1 Ticket Tracker

> **Single source of truth.** Every worker (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) reads this before starting and updates it when done.
> Commit changes to this file on the working branch. Merge conflicts = discussion needed.

## Status Key
- `done` — merged to main, verified
- `wip:worker` — in progress (e.g. `wip:codex`, `wip:claude`, `wip:gemini`)
- `review` — code written, needs QA before merge
- `next` — ready to pick up
- `blocked:XXX` — waiting on ticket XXX
- `skip` — not needed for V1

## Platform Assignment Rules
- **Claude Code** — tickets that touch `src/main.js`, have 2+ dependencies, or need cross-system wiring. Integration + QA hub.
- **Codex / Gemini** — self-contained modules with 0-1 dependencies already on `main`. Never touch `src/main.js`.
- **Dependency rule**: a ticket is only `next` if ALL its `Depends` are `done`. If not, it's `blocked:XXX`.
- **Parallel rule**: tickets with no shared `Depends` and no shared files can run simultaneously on different platforms.

|--------|----------|----------------|
| S7R-051 | Codex | Medic Firefly — standalone support module, no main.js |
| S7R-053 | Gemini | Striker Hawk — standalone support module, no main.js |

## Rules
1. **Claim before you start**: set status to `wip:yourname` and fill in branch + owner.
2. **One owner per ticket**: no two workers on the same ticket.
3. **main.js lock**: only one worker modifies `src/main.js` at a time. Current lock holder noted below.
4. **Update on completion**: set to `review` when PR is ready, `done` when merged.
5. **Dependency check**: before starting, verify all `Depends` tickets are `done` on main.
6. **QA rule**: every `review` ticket gets QA'd by Claude Code before merging to main.
7. **Build gate**: every branch must pass `npx vite build` before marking `review`. If it doesn't build, it's not ready.
8. **Don't invent scope**: implement exactly what the ticket spec says. No bonus features, no "while I'm here" refactors. If you see something worth doing, note it in your PR description — don't do it.
9. **Match existing patterns**: read `src/systems/power.js` and `src/config/flags.js` for module style. Use the same export conventions, JSDoc style, and error handling patterns.
10. **Progressive extraction**: every ticket that modifies `src/main.js` must leave it shorter (net lines ≤ 0). Extract, don't add.
11. **No shared state mutation from modules**: modules receive state as params or import `S` from `src/state.js`. Never create a second mutable singleton.
12. **Conflict protocol**: if your branch has merge conflicts with main, rebase onto latest main and re-run `npx vite build` before marking `review`. Don't merge broken code.
13. **Stay informed**: (a) Steven routes tasks and relays cross-worker changes. (b) Every PR describes files changed and exports added/modified. (c) Every merge gets a one-liner in the Merge Log below. Workers: read the last few log entries when starting a session.
14. **Start with TL;DR**: every ticket update must begin with a plain-language TL;DR before technical details.

**Currently held by**: _nobody (unlocked)_
**Queue**: _(empty)_
> When you need main.js, write your name here. When done, clear it and notify the next in queue.

## Merge Log
> Every merge to main gets a one-liner here. Workers: read the last few entries when starting a session to see what changed since you last pulled.
